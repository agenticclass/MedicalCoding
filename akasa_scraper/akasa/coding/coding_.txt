Technology customized for your health system Our technology is not generic — it’s not one algorithm that every health system shares. AKASA Medical Coding is powered by a large language model (LLM) built specifically for each health system. Your LLM is trained on our foundational model, which includes CMS best practices, the latest coding standards, coding guidelines, coding clinics, and health system-specific historical data. We then further fine-tune it on your clinical and financial data to learn your specific nuances. This means your coding is more accurate and comprehensive.
