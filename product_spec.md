- Intelligent extraction of relevant information for coding
- Minimizes system switching for coders

### 2. AI-Powered Code Recommendations
- Generates ICD-10 and other relevant medical codes
- Provides confidence level indicators for each recommendation
- Supports multiple service lines simultaneously
- Works with complex inpatient settings

### 3. Transparent Justification System
- AI-generated justifications for each code recommendation
- Direct quotes from source documents
- Links to relevant sections in clinical documentation
- Clear explanation of reasoning behind each code suggestion

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Identifies missed coding opportunities
- Flags potential errors or inconsistencies
- Helps improve Case Mix Index (CMI)
- Supports clinical quality measures tracking
