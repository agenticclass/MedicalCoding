Vice President and CFO Methodist Health System
“Claims status has been automated to the point that what used to take over seven minutes to determine is now down to a minute. The result has been an increase in yield, which is up by at least 1% on gross revenue of $3 billion.”
Seeing results with AKASA
Methodist Health System, a leading provider of care in Nebraska, has experienced significant growth in volumes over the last few years. To effectively manage the increased volumes, while continuing to manage their cost-to-collect, the health system used AI-powered automation by AKASA to support revenue cycle production out of the centralized business office.
