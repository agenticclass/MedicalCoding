We’ve had the same discussion in the revenue cycle for the past 25 years: how do we reduce churn, increase productivity, or drive down denials? We should be watching automation do everything we need it to do, embracing the fact that we can’t meet modern demands with humans alone. We haven’t significantly decreased cost-to-collect in ten years, so something has to change. We need to think about all those same twenty-five-year-old conversations and how automation fits into them.
