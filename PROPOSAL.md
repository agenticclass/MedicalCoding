# MediCodeAI: Medical Coding Generative AI Assistant

## Elevator Pitch
MediCodeAI revolutionizes medical coding by combining the precision of FastAPI with the power of generative AI. Our solution transforms tedious coding tasks into efficient, AI-assisted workflows, enabling coders to focus on validation and quality assurance rather than manual code assignment.

## Problem Statement
Medical coding is a complex, time-consuming process that requires:
- Extensive knowledge of coding standards (ICD-10, CPT, HCPCS)
- Precise interpretation of medical documentation
- Constant updates to maintain compliance
- High accuracy requirements with minimal error tolerance

Current manual processes lead to:
- Increased coding backlogs
- Higher error rates
- Coder fatigue and burnout
- Slower revenue cycle times

## Solution Overview
MediCodeAI provides:
1. **AI-Assisted Code Generation**
   - Automatically suggests codes based on medical documentation
   - Provides multiple coding options with confidence scores
   - Explains coding rationale using natural language

2. **Validation Workflow**
   - Highlights potential coding conflicts
   - Provides reference documentation for validation
   - Tracks coding decisions for audit purposes

3. **Continuous Learning**
   - Adapts to new coding guidelines
   - Learns from user corrections
   - Maintains coding history for reference

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Jinja2 templates for web interface
- **Backend**: FastAPI for RESTful services
- **AI Engine**: Fine-tuned LLM for medical coding
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for coding history and user data
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 with JWT tokens

## Sample Inputs and Outputs

### Input 1: Medical Documentation
```
