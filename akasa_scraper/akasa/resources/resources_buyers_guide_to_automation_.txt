The opportunity going forward for provider organizations is to expand their ambitions and scope for automation. Instead of identifying dozens of small, discrete use-cases and never getting past the first few due to high setup and maintenance costs, it’s now time to take a more comprehensive approach. It's time to move towards foundational end-to-end automation for entire functions will drive giant leaps in efficiency.
